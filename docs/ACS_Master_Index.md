## What's Proved vs What's Open

### Proved (theorem-level, with proof)
1. SU(3) as closure attractor of Palatini bracket (Paper A)
2. λ_φ = 2√3/27 from Koide projection (Paper A)
3. α₂ = 0 by representation theory (Paper A §5.5.1)
4. β_c = 0 at tree level → V_CKM = I no-go (Paper A §5.5.1)
5. Killing-orthogonality tr([X,Y]·X) = 0 (Paper C Theorem 4.1)

7. Wronskian is Lie bracket but not Poisson (Paper B Remark 2.3)
8. RH ⇒ stationarity of F_N (Paper B)
9. Renormalized stability under RH (Paper B Theorem 2.4)
10. **Adjoint Spectral Minimization and Bipartite Adjoint Spectral Minimization and Bipartite Adjoint Spectral Minimization and Bipartite Adjoint Spectral Minimization and Bipartite Adjoint Spectral Minimization and Bipartite Signature Selection in Clifford Algebras in Clifford Algebras in Clifford Algebras in Clifford Algebras in Clifford Algebras from adjoint spectral activity (N2 Theorem 1)**

### Numerically verified (not yet theorem-level)
11. Compact → Euclidean, noncompact → nontrivial (N2 Observation)
12. ⟨2,3⟩ lattice membership of PS ratios (N1)
13. IR null test for lattice imprint (N1 §4)
14. 72% parity-odd holonomy under Lorentzian grading (Type IIb)

### Explicitly open (flagged in papers)
15. Coleman-Weinberg analysis (6 → 5 inputs?)
16. FeynRules/UFO export
17. Hilbert-Pólya operator construction
18. Multi-cluster weighted proof (N2 Theorem 1(iii))
19. Extension to exceptional algebras (N2)
20. Action principle that produces S_f (Route B completion)

### Explicitly disproved (negative results retained as boundaries)
21. ad³ = 2·ad for integer matrices (impossible: requires λ = 1/√2)
22. Universal 2π inversion at three steps (sl(4) is hyperbolic)
23. Wronskian as Poisson bracket (Leibniz fails by −fgh')
24. IR lattice imprint of ⟨2,3⟩ structure (z-scores null)

26. Adjoint Spectral Minimization and Bipartite Adjoint Spectral Minimization and Bipartite Adjoint Spectral Minimization and Bipartite Adjoint Spectral Minimization and Bipartite Adjoint Spectral Minimization and Bipartite Signature Selection in Clifford Algebras in Clifford Algebras in Clifford Algebras in Clifford Algebras in Clifford Algebras from Killing form (Route A — closed)

## Recommended Submission Order

1. **N2 (Adjoint Spectral Minimization and Bipartite Adjoint Spectral Minimization and Bipartite Adjoint Spectral Minimization and Bipartite Adjoint Spectral Minimization and Bipartite Adjoint Spectral Minimization and Bipartite Signature Selection in Clifford Algebras in Clifford Algebras in Clifford Algebras in Clifford Algebras in Clifford Algebras)** — standalone, highest novelty, smallest attack surface
2. **Paper A** — the main paper, references everything else
3. **Paper C** — algebraic foundations, supports Paper A
4. **Paper B** — most independent, can go separately
5. **N1** — short note, cite from Paper A

N2 first because it's the session's strongest result and stands alone.
Paper A last because it's the most complex and benefits from the
companion notes being available as cited references.
