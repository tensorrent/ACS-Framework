Write the full classical action explicitly and verify symbolic

  Light neutrino masses: m_ν^{eff} = m_D M_R^{-1} m_D^T

TOTAL LAGRANGIAN:
  L = L_gravity + L_gauge + L_Higgs + L_fermion
  
RENORMALIZABILITY:
  All terms have mass dimension ≤ 4.
  Gauge invariance restricts counterterms to be of the same form.

CHECK 4: Cross-coupling α_1 Tr(Φ^†Φ) Tr(Δ_R^†Δ_R)
  Each trace is a singlet; their product is a singlet ✓

CHECK 5: Cross-coupling α_2 Tr(Φ^† T^A Φ) · Tr(Δ_R^† T^A Δ_R)
  The SU(4) adjoint index A is summed — overall singlet ✓
  (Note: for Φ in (1,2,2), T^A is a trivial color representation, so
  this specific term requires Φ to be in some non-trivial SU(4) rep.
  In standard PS, Φ is (1,2,2) so this coupling VANISHES identically.
  Paper A's α_2 must therefore refer to a DIFFERENT cross-coupling,
  likely with the 15-plet Higgs or with fermion bilinears.)

⚠️  FLAG: the α_2 coupling needs to be specified more carefully.
In the minimal PS model with Φ ~ (1,2,2) only, the cross-couplings
reduce to α_1 alone plus the β_c CP-violating term. A true five-
parameter model may require extending the Higgs sector — for example
adding Σ ~ (15, 1, 1) which would permit the α_2 coupling as written.

THIS IS A REAL GAP IN THE PAPER A TREATMENT that needs clarification.

The Palatini bracket provides six specific inputs to the Lagrangian:

  1. Structure constants f^{ABC} of SU(4)
     (from sl(4,R) chirality map J: sl(3,R) → su(3) and its extensions)
  
  2. Gauge coupling g = 4/3 at the PS scale
     (Paper A Table 2)
  
  3. Higgs quartic λ_eff = λ_1 + λ_2 = 2√3/27
     (Koide projection of the bi-doublet, modulo 0.85% residual)
  
  4. Δ_R self-coupling constraint: 2ρ_1 + ρ_2 = g² = 16/9
     (Palatini pairing identity)
  
  5. Yukawa ratio h̃/h = 2/3 from the bi-doublet sector
     (bracket between Φ and Φ̃ directions)
  
  6. Three generations (Theorem C: rank of ad_T_BL)

These SIX INPUTS reduce the SM's 19+ parameters to 7.
The remaining 5 free parameters (+ 2 calibrations) sit in:
  • The Higgs sector (tan β, ρ_1, α_1, α_2 if extended, β_c)
  • Fermion Yukawas (hierarchies not fully determined)

The Lagrangian above is written in compact index-free form. To use
with FeynRules, one would:

  1. Define the gauge group:
       G = U(1)_h × SU(2)_L × SU(2)_R × SU(4)_C
       (hypercharge emerges post-breaking of SU(2)_R × SU(4))
  
  2. Declare each field with its representation:
       S[0] :: Phi(1,2,2) — bi-doublet Higgs
       S[1] :: DR(10,1,3)  — triplet Higgs
       F[0] :: psi_L(4,2,1) with 3 generations
       F[1] :: psi_R(4,1,2) with 3 generations
       V[0..5] :: the six gauge bosons
  
  3. Write the Lagrangian using FeynRules' expansion conventions.
  
  4. Export as UFO → load in MadGraph or similar.

I have NOT run FeynRules in this session. The Lagrangian above is
presented in standard textbook form, consistent with standard PS
conventions (e.g., Fonseca 2013 thesis, Assad-Fornal-Grinstein 2017).

ESTIMATED EFFORT for full FeynRules implementation: 1-2 months by
a competent postdoc familiar with FeynRules and PS models. This is
Phase D1 of the roadmap, outside this session's scope.

PATH TO QUANTUM PREDICTIONS (repeated from earlier session):
  D1 (1-2 months): FeynRules UFO

  D4 (12-24 months): full one-loop EWPO
  Total: ~3 years focused postdoc effort

This Lagrangian is a necessary starting point. It is in hand.
No new derivations of observables follow from writing it down —
the derivations require D1-D4.
